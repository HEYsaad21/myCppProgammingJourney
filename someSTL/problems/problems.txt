Practice problem - 1

Write a function template swapValues that swaps two variables of any data type.

Sample input/output :

1 2                     2 1

Nafisa Moeen            Moeen Nafisa

1.2 2.5                 2.5 1.2



Practice problems

2. Write a template function findMax that takes an array of any type and returns the
maximum element.

3. Write a program that counts the frequency of each string in a given series of input of
strings. Firstly take input what is the number of series(Use C++ STL)

Input: 5

“ hello ; cse205; world; world; hello"

Output:

cse205 -> 1

hello -> 2

world -> 2

4. Write a class template Calculator<T> with functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
two numbers.

Create objects of type int, float, and double to test.

Handle division by zero gracefully

5. Create a template function compareAndPrint between 2 different types data which one is
greater and which is smaller or if equal , print “equal”

6. Write a class template that stores two different values (like std::pair).

Implement a method display() to print them.

7. Write a program to:

Take n integers into a vector.

Find and print the maximum and minimum element (use *max_element,
*min_element).

Sort the vector from ascending to descending and viceversa

Print the final vector.

8. Build a small dictionary using map<string, vector<string>> where each word maps to a
list of synonyms.

happy → {“joyful”, “cheerful”, “content”}

fast → {“quick”, “rapid”, “speedy”}

Some resources to practice C++ STL

https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/123251 (You can practice vector & Map mainly) as from
these two topics questions can come. Other topics of STL are optional for you to practice
other than your academics.
